# Project Setup Guide

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a MySQL database, create a user, grant permissions, and configure the database connection for this FastAPI project.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have MySQL installed. If not, you can download it from [MySQL official site](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

## Setting Up the Database

### 1. Access MySQL Command Line

Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the MySQL command line interface (CLI):

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```
Enter the root password when prompted. If youâ€™re using a different MySQL superuser, replace root with the appropriate username.

### 2. Create a New Database

Run the following SQL command to create a new database. Replace your_database_name with your desired database name:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

### 3. Create a New User
Create a new user with a secure password. Replace your_username and your_password with your preferred username and password:

```sql
CREATE USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
```
### 4. Grant Permissions
Grant the newly created user the necessary permissions to the database:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_database_name.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';
```
### 5. Flush Privileges
Apply the changes to ensure the new user permissions are updated:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
### 6. Exit MySQL CLI
Type `exit` and press Enter to exit the MySQL command line interface.

## Updating the database.py File
### 1. Open database.py
Open the database.py file in your project directory.

### 2. Update Database Connection Information
Replace the placeholder values in the DATABASE_URL variable with your actual database credentials. Update it as follows:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "mysql+aiomysql://your_username:your_password@localhost/your_database_name"
```
* `your_username`: The username you created.
* `your_password`: The password for that user.
* `localhost`: The address of your MySQL server (use localhost if it's on your local machine).
* `your_database_name`: The name of the database you created.

Example:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "mysql+aiomysql://myuser:mypassword@localhost/mydatabase"
```

### 3. Save the Changes
Save and close the database.py file.

## Initializing the Database
### 1. Run `init_db.py`
To initialize the database with the required tables and schema, run the init_db.py script. Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies.
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing init_db.py and execute:

```bash
python init_db.py
```
This script will create the tables and any other necessary initial setup in your database.

## Running the Application
### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Run the Application
Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Replace main with the name of your main module if different.

## Troubleshooting
* **Connection Issues**: Ensure that MySQL is running and accessible. Check that the database URL in database.py is correct.
* **Permission Errors**: Verify that the user has the appropriate permissions and that you have granted them correctly.
* **Initialization Errors**: Ensure that init_db.py has been executed successfully without errors.
